# cookie_clicker

Requirements
I have implemented all actions required from the user story. I have kept my code organised and reusable by using functions and used event listeners to handle user interactions. I have a setInterval that increments the cookie count, including relevant game information and also used local storage so that the users game state is saved and can be restored. I also Fetch upgrade data from the provided API ("https://cookie-upgrade-api.vercel.app/api/upgrades").

🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.
🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch.
🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.
