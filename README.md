# cookie_clicker

Game Description (UK English)
This is a cookie clicker game where you click the cookie to earn enough to buy upgrades. You can hover over the upgrade buttons to see the benefits each one provides. If you close your browser, your game will resume from where you left off when you return, ensuring no progress is lost.

Reflection

üéØ What requirements did you achieve?
I have successfully implemented all the actions outlined in the user story. My code is well-organised and reusable, using functions and event listeners to manage user interactions. A setInterval function increments the cookie count and updates relevant game information. Additionally, I've used local storage to save the user's game state, allowing it to be restored when they return. The upgrade data is fetched from the provided API ("https://cookie-upgrade-api.vercel.app/api/upgrades").

To enhance the user experience, I‚Äôve added various sound effects for different actions: purchasing items, clicking the cookie, resetting the game, and attempting a transaction with insufficient cookies. I‚Äôve used try/catch blocks to handle potential errors, and you can hover over the buttons to view the benefits of each upgrade.

üèπ Additional Reflections:
I‚Äôve realised that to work effectively and efficiently, I need a structured approach to planning my projects. In my first two projects, I rushed ahead and found myself lost for hours, especially when diving into CSS. For this project, I researched and experimented with different planning methods, eventually creating a structure that works for me. This approach kept me on track and helped minimise distractions.
