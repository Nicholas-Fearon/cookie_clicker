# cookie_clicker

I have implemented all the actions required by the user story. To keep my code organised and reusable, I’ve utilised functions and added event listeners to manage user interactions. I’ve also used setInterval to increment the cookie count, incorporating relevant game information. Additionally, I’ve implemented local storage so that the user's game state is saved and can be restored. I fetch upgrade data from the provided API ("https://cookie-upgrade-api.vercel.app/api/upgrades").

To enhance the user experience, I’ve included various sound effects for actions like purchasing a new item, clicking the cookie, resetting the game, and when there aren’t enough cookies for a transaction. I’ve also used try/catch to handle errors.
